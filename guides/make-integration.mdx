## Advanced: Using the North Reports App

The North Reports app is now available in Make.com! After accepting the invite above, you can use the dedicated North Reports modules instead of HTTP modules.

### Benefits of Using the App
- Appears in Make's app search
- Pre-configured authentication
- Visual module builder
- Better user experience
- Automatic updates
- Built-in error handling
- Pre-mapped fields

### Available Modules

**Triggers:**
- New Report - Triggers when a new report is created

**Actions:**
- Create Report - Creates a new North Report
- Update Report - Updates an existing report
- Get Report - Retrieves a report by ID
- List Reports - Lists all reports with filters

### Switching from HTTP to App Modules

If you're currently using HTTP modules, you can easily switch:
1. Delete your HTTP module
2. Add the corresponding North Reports module
3. Reconnect your account (uses the same API key)
4. Map your fields (they should match automatically)

## Polling Best Practices

When using HTTP modules to poll for new data:

1. **Use appropriate intervals**: 15 minutes is usually sufficient
2. **Store last check time**: Use Make's data stores to track the last poll
3. **Filter results**: Only process items created since last check
4. **Respect rate limits**: Max 100 requests per hour on the free plan

## Example: Complete Automation

Here's a complete Make scenario that:
1. Polls for new reports every 15 minutes
2. Creates a task in Asana for each new report
3. Sends a Slack notification to your team

**Module 1: HTTP - Get Reports**
```
URL: https://api.northreports.com/v1/reports?limit=10
Method: GET
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer north_sk_live_xxx
  Content-Type: application/json
```

**Module 2: Iterator**
Parse the reports array

**Module 3: Filter**
```
created_at > {{datastore.last_check}}
```

**Module 4: Asana - Create Task**
```
Project: North Reports
Name: New Report: {{address}}
Notes: Price: ${{price}}, Beds: {{bedrooms}}, Baths: {{bathrooms}}
```

**Module 5: Slack - Send Message**
```
Channel: #real-estate
Message: New North Report created: {{address}}
Link: https://northreports.com/north/{{id}}
```

**Module 6: Update Data Store**
```
Store: last_check
Value: {{now}}
```

## Error Handling

Make.com has built-in error handling:

1. **Add Error Handler** to any module
2. **Configure retry logic** for transient failures
3. **Set up notifications** for critical errors
4. **Use fallback actions** when API is unavailable

## Rate Limits

North Reports API has these limits:

| Plan | Requests/Hour |
|------|---------------|
| Free | 100 |
| Pro  | 500 |
| Enterprise | 10,000 |

Rate limit headers are included in every response:
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1642348800
