# Authentication

The North API uses API keys for authentication. Each key is scoped to your team and can have specific permissions.

## Getting your API key

1. Log into your [North Dashboard](https://northreports.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Zapier Integration")
5. Select the permissions you need
6. Copy your key immediately - **you won't see it again!**

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secure! Treat it like a password. Never commit it to version control or share it publicly.
</Warning>

## Using your API key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer north_sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Example request

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://zkqcqgjbsigjdwzmnwmp.supabase.co/functions/v1/api-v1-users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer north_sk_live_YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```

## API Key format

North API keys follow this format:

```
north_sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

- `north_sk_` - Identifies it as a North secret key
- `live_` - Indicates production environment
- `xxx...` - 32 character random string

## Permissions

When creating an API key, you can scope its access:

| Permission | Actions | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **reports** | read, create, update, delete, publish | Manage North reports |
| **comps** | read, create, delete | Manage comparable properties |
| **showings** | read, create, update, delete | Manage showing events |
| **social** | read, import | Import social media data |
| **insights** | read, generate | AI-generated insights |
| **team** | read | View team information |
| **webhooks** | read, create, update, delete | Manage webhook subscriptions |

<Tip>
  Follow the principle of least privilege. Only grant the permissions your integration actually needs.
</Tip>

## Common authentication errors

### 401 Unauthorized

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid API key",
    "status": 401
  }
}
```

**Causes:**
- Missing `Authorization` header
- Incorrect key format
- Key doesn't exist or was revoked

### 403 Forbidden

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Permission denied: reports:create",
    "status": 403
  }
}
```

**Cause:** Your API key doesn't have the required permission for this operation.

## Key management best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rotate keys regularly">
    Create new keys periodically and revoke old ones. This limits exposure if a key is compromised.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive names">
    Name keys based on their purpose: "Zapier Automation", "CRM Sync", "Marketing Dashboard"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set expiration dates">
    For temporary integrations, set an expiration date on the key.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor usage">
    Check the "Last Used" timestamp in your dashboard to identify unused keys.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="One key per integration">
    Create separate keys for each integration. This makes it easy to revoke access without affecting other systems.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Revoking a key

If you suspect a key has been compromised:

1. Go to **Settings > Integrations**
2. Find the compromised key
3. Click **Revoke**
4. The key is immediately invalidated

Any requests using that key will receive a 401 error.

## Testing your key

Use the "Get Current User" endpoint to verify your key is working:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET \
  "https://zkqcqgjbsigjdwzmnwmp.supabase.co/functions/v1/api-v1-users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer north_sk_live_YOUR_KEY"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch(
  'https://zkqcqgjbsigjdwzmnwmp.supabase.co/functions/v1/api-v1-users',
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer north_sk_live_YOUR_KEY'
    }
  }
);

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'https://zkqcqgjbsigjdwzmnwmp.supabase.co/functions/v1/api-v1-users',
    headers={
        'Authorization': 'Bearer north_sk_live_YOUR_KEY'
    }
)

print(response.json())
```
</CodeGroup>

A successful response means your key is valid and you're ready to start building!
